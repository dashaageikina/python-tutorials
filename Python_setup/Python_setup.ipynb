    "# Python Setup\n",
    "## Dasha Ageikina, Ph.D., for Glynmoran\n",
    "\n",

    "This document is meant to help you get started with Python programming using Jupyter Notebook.\n",

    "## Step 1: Installing Python & Jupyter Notebooks with Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use **Anaconda**, a free and easy way to install Python.\n",
    "You can install Python using other platforms but I find Anaconda convenient due to Jupyter Notebook - you can create scripts that are easy to read and collaborate on. It's a good idea to use them for your GitHub portfolio if you plan to create one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download & Install Anaconda\n",
    "1. Go to the [Anaconda Individual Edition download page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).\n",
    "2. Download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n",
    "3. Follow the installation instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launch Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Once installed:\n",
    "1. Open **Anaconda-Navigator**.\n",
    "2. Click **Launch** under **Jupyter Notebook**.\n",
    "3. A browser window will open with the notebook interface.\n",
    "4. You can create a new notebook from the top right corner (click “New” → “Python 3”).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Writing Your First Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Jupyter notebook, enter this in a cell and press **Shift + Enter**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Add Text to Your Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter Notebook, there are two main types of cells:\n",
    "- **Code cells**: where you write and run Python code.\n",
    "- **Markdown cells**: where you write formatted text (like this document!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells let you add:\n",
    "- **Headings**, **bold**, *italics*\n",
    "- Bullet points\n",
    "- Numbered lists\n",
    "- [Links](https://example.com)\n",
    "- Images\n",
    "- Mathematical formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells are convenient to make your code more readable.\n",
    "### How to Use a Markdown Cell\n",
    "1. Click on a cell.\n",
    "2. From the top menu, select **Cell → Cell Type → Markdown**.\n",
    "3. Write your text using [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). For instance, type in : \"This is **bold** text and this is *italic* text.\"\n",
    "4. Press **Shift + Enter** to render the text.\n",

    "## Step 4: Install and Import Libraries in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries are collections of pre-written code that help you do specific tasks — like working with data, creating charts, or making web requests — without having to write everything from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Import a Library\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a library, you first need to **import** it. Try to run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(25))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see \"5.0\" in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Install a Library (if it's not built-in)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some libraries are not included with Python by default. You can install them using pip (Python’s package installer).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a Jupyter notebook, you can run this in a code cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pip install selenium\n",
    "```\n",
    "After installing a library, you should \"restart\" your Jupyter Notebook: **Kernel → Restart**. You won't need to run \"pip install selenium\" again, but you will need to rerun all the other code cells after restarting your kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel is what runs your code and remembers your variables. Restarting the kernel clears all stored variables and memory, so you will need to re-run any code cells you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Save Your Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are saved as `.ipynb` files. To save your work, click **File → Save as...**\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter also autosaves your work periodically, but it's a good habit to save manually before closing the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can export your notebook to different formats for sharing or presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to **File → Download as**\n",
    "2. Choose one of the available formats:\n",
    "   - **Notebook (.ipynb)** — the default format\n",
    "   - **HTML (.html)** — viewable in a browser\n",
    "   - **PDF (.pdf)** — great for printing or sharing\n",
    "   - **Markdown (.md)** — clean, text-based format for documentation\n",
    "   - **Python (.py)** — the code only, as a Python script\n",
    "   \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Learn programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[The course by Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) is one of the most popular interactive courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer an ebook, [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/) seems to be a good resource, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the comprehensive guides on all the resources:\n",
    "1. [If you have 0 programming experience](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)\n",
